Xata's pricing model is carefully designed to cater to different user needs, from individual projects to high-scale enterprise applications. For information on pricing, billing, and usage limits, you can refer to our [pricing page](/pricing).

## Billing terms

### Concurrency limit

The concurrency limit is the maximum number of queries that are executed in parallel. It is different from a "connections limit" because the queries are counted only while they are actually executing, and more connections can be accepted and queued. It protects against very slow queries.

The maximum number of simultaneous requests that can be processed at any given time.

If the request concurrency limit is exceeded, additional requests will fail with a `429` HTTP status.

These allocations are designed to prioritize and balance the workload across the different store types based on requirements and usage patterns.

### Data Size

The data size on disk denotes the quantity of data held within the transactional database.

This size limit is considered a soft-limit and is not strictly enforced in real-time. However, if you exceed this limit, it indicates that your data storage requirements may be approaching a critical level. In such cases, we recommend you explore potential solutions with [Xata Support](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us) to optimize and scale your data storage.

### Request Rate limit

The maximum number of requests allowed per second. If the request rate limit is exceeded, additional requests will fail with a `429` HTTP status. This limit exists on shared Xata instances to ensure reliability for all users on the instance. The rate limit for the Free plan is 75 queries per second (qps).

### Storage

Database storage currnetly bundles storage on disk with I/O rates and compute costs. The price per GB relefects a combination of all three. Search engine storage currnetly bundles storage on disk with I/O rates and compute costs. The price per GB relefects a combination of all three. The amount of storage on disk your file attachments consume.
