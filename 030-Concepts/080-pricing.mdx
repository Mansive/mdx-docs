Xata's pricing model is carefully designed to cater to different user needs, from individual projects to high-scale enterprise applications. Ensure you check out our [pricing page](/pricing) for a comprehensive overview of the pricing structure. This page provides additional information on pricing, billing, and usage limits.

## Billing terms

### Concurrency limit

The concurrency limit refers to the number of queries that can run simultaneously. It's the cap on how many requests we process at once. Unlike a "connections limit", this doesn't count the total connections, but only the active queries. Xata doesn't limit the number of connections.

We've set specific limits to balance workloads across different store types. The number of concurrency limit depends on the plan and are allocated to each branch:

- **Free plan:** 15 parallel requests (6 primary + 9 from replicas) to the database
- **Pro plan:** 45 parallel request (18 primary + 27 from replicas) to the database

> The Pro tier has a 'soft' limit to guard against unintended excessive use or misuse. [Contact us](mailto:contactus@xata.io) if you require a higher limit.

Concurrency limits apply to each branch in the workspace.

If the number of simultaneous requests surpasses the concurrency limit, any additional requests will be temporarily queued for 100ms. If the volume of parallel requests doesn't decrease within that time, the queued requests will fail, returning an HTTP 429 status.

### Database storage

The disk's storage represents the amount of data stored in the transactional database. Database storage in Xata encompasses not only disk space but also I/O rates and compute resources. The listed price per GB integrates the three components.

This size limit is considered a soft-limit and is not strictly enforced in real-time. However, if you exceed this limit, it indicates that your data storage requirements may be approaching a critical level. If you exceed this limit on the Free plan, you'll be asked to upgrade. We recommend you explore solutions with [Xata Support](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us) to optimize and scale your data storage.

### Point-in-Time Recovery

Point-in-time recovery (PITR) enables the restoration of data to a specific timestamp. It uses continuous transaction log backups to facilitate this process. You can use PITR for the following:

- Accidental data deletions: Recover data to its state immediately prior to unintentional deletions.
- Database corruption: Restore the database to a pre-corruption state.
- Malformed updates: Rollback changes from updates that led to unexpected or undesired results.
- Security breaches: In the event of data compromise or unauthorized alterations, revert the database to a secure, pre-breach state.

PITR operates by consistently backing up transaction logs. It grants you the capability to revert data to any designated point within the specified retention window.

### Rate limit

Each shared Xata instance has a set request rate limit to maintain consistent performance for all users. If requests surpass this threshold, they will return a 429 HTTP status. The following limits apply:

- **Free tier:** Limited to 75 requests/second (qps).
- **Pro tier:** Starts with a 150 requests/second (qps), which can be adjusted upon request.

The Pro plan has a flexible limit, while the Free plan has a strict, fixed limit.

These limits are designated for each branch in the workspace.

## Pricing plans

### Common features across all plans

All Xata plans, irrespective of their pricing, include the following features:

- **PostgreSQL database:** Xata uses Postgres, which serves as the backbone for storing structured, relational data securely. Each plan starts with 10 branches and 15 GB of storage space, but you can get more space if you need it.

## FAQ

<Expand title="Usage limits and activity ">
  ##### Is there a maximum number of reads and writes per month?

No, you can serve as many reads and writes as you want within the rate limit, which is defined per second (resets every second).

##### What happens if I exceed the rate limit?

If you exceed the rate limit on Xata, you will receive a 429 HTTP status as a notification of the overload. Xata’s pricing structure is specifically tailored to cater to diverse user needs, from individual endeavors to large-scale enterprise applications. Detailed information about pricing, billing, and usage limits is available in the documentation on this page. Additionally, our [pricing page](https://xata.io/pricing) offers a thorough breakdown of our pricing model.

##### Can I increase my rate limit?

Yes, you can increase the limit by upgrading to the Pro plan, if you are on the Free plan. You can also contact us if you would like to discuss pricing options.

##### Do the reads and writes per second differ depending on the plan chosen?

No. Regardless of the plan you chose, the reads and writes per second remain consistent. This means that users on different plans will experience the same performance in terms of data access.

##### How is the data size measured?

We measure and determine data size by database storage, search engine storage, file attachment storage.

##### What happens when the rate limit or concurrency limits are reached?

When the rate limit or concurrency limits are reached, we will throttle your requests and answer with a 429 status code. Your app will be in a degraded mode, but only the requests over the limit are affected. The rate limit is reset every second, and the concurrency limit is measured at any given time.

##### Will my database be suspended after a period of inactivity?'

No. Even if it’s not accessed, we don’t put your database to sleep, even if your'e on the free plan. We want projects of all kinds to be able to depend on Xata even if they are not paying.

</Expand>

<Expand title="Billing and special pricing">
  #### How long is a billing cycle?

A billing period lasts 30 days and begins on the day you choose and start your plan.

##### When will I be billed?

For our Pro and Enterprise plans, an invoice will be generated every 30 days based on the date you initiated your plan. This invoice will cover the past month's usage and any previous outstanding amounts.

##### Do you have a program for start-ups program?,

Yes, we do, please get in touch with us for details.'

##### We are a non-profit. Do you have discounts?',

Yes! In fact, the idea for Xata was born out of a non-profit. Get in touch with us, we’d love to help.

</Expand>

<Expand title="Changing plans">
  ##### What happens on upgrade and downgrade?

If you adjust your subscription level mid-billing cycle, we'll prorate the charges or credits for the remaining days in your 30-day period from the plan's start date. This ensures accurate billing based on your actual usage during that time.
