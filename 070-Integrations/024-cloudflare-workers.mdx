You will need a cloudflare account to deploy your application.

The completed [Cloudflare and Xata code](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/getting-started-cloudflare-workers) for this
guide is available via the [Xata `examples` repo](https://github.com/xataio/examples) on GitHub.

## Before you begin

Install the Xata CLI:

```sh
npm install -g @xata.io/cli
```

Authenticate the Xata CLI with your Xata account. If you don't already have an account, you can use the
same workflow to sign up for a new account. Run the following command to begin the authentication workflow:

```sh
xata auth login
```

On completion, the command will create a new API key for your user account, which you should see in the \[account
settings page within the Xata UI]\[1]. That key will also be stored locally on your computer (the location might vary for
each OS). It looks like this:

```toml
# .config/xata/credentials
[default]
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Create a new Cloudflare app

1.  Create a new Cloudflare workers endpoint, accepting the default prompt options:

    ```sh
    npm create cloudflare@latest
    ```

2.  Once the command has completed, go to the `getting-started-cloudflare-workers` directory, and run the application:

    ```sh
    $ npm run wrangler dev
    ```

By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:8787`. When visiting this URL "Hello World" should be shown in your browser.

## Create a new database

With the Xata CLI installed and logged in and a new application in place, use the Xata CLI to create a new
database. Accept all the prompt defaults for the following command except for the region selection, where
you should choose the region closest to your application users:

```sh
xata init
```

On completion, the CLI will create `.env`, `.xatarc`, and `src/xata.ts` files within your project folder with the
correct credentials to access your database.

Your `.env` file should look something like this:

```bash title=".env"
XATA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
XATA_BRANCH=main
````

Since you selected TypeScript support after running `xata init`, it also created files that provide typings and functions to call using Xata's
TypeScript SDK. This will additionally be referenced in the `.xatarc` file as follows:

```json
{
  "databaseUrl": "https://my-xata-app-database-url",
  "codegen": {
    "output": "src/xata.ts"
  }
}
```

The `src/xata.ts` file includes generated code you should typically never touch manually.

## Inject into wrangler during development

Create a new file called `.dev.vars` at the root of your project
Copy these env vars into this file so you have access to them in dev mode.

```
XATA_API_KEY="xau_*********************************"
XATA_BRANCH="main"
```

### Define the database schema and import CSV data

You can use the \[Xata UI]\[0] to manually define your schema and add data. However, for this guide, you'll use
the Xata CLI and a CSV file to:

1.  Auto-generate a schema based on column headings for names and data types inferred from the column values
2.  Import data to the database

First, download the
[example blog posts CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/examples/main/seed/blog-posts.csv).
You can either do this manually or by running the following command:

```sh
curl --create-dirs -o seed/blog-posts.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xataio/examples/main/seed/blog-posts.csv
```

Next, import the CSV:

```sh
xata import csv seed/blog-posts.csv --table Posts --create
```

If you open the Xata UI and navigate to your database, you will see the **Posts** table. Alternatively,
you can run the command `xata browse` to open a browser window.

Click **Schema** to see the schema definition with the inferred data types:
