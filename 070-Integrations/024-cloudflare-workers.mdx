[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) is a content delivery and security service that optimizes website performance and mitigates security risks for sites. [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) allow you to run code directly on Cloudflare's global network, reducing latency and improving performance. They're ideal for tasks like customizing web content, handling API requests, and modifying web traffic, all executed closer to the user for faster response times.

> You'll need a Cloudflare account to deploy your application.

The completed [Cloudflare and Xata code](https://github.com/xataio/examples/tree/main/apps/getting-started-cloudflare-workers) is available in the [Xata `examples` repo](https://github.com/xataio/examples) on GitHub.

### Installation

- [Install the Xata CLI and authenticate](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/installation)

### Create a new Cloudflare app

Choose the hello world example and accept the default prompt options.

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

After the command has completed, navigate to the `getting-started-cloudflare-workers` directory, and run the application locally:

```sh
$ npm run wrangler dev
```

By default, the application runs on `http://localhost:8787`. When visiting this URL "Hello World" should be shown in your browser.

### Deploy your app remotely

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Preview your Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev.` When you visit this URL in your browser you should see "Hello World" returned.

### Install Xata Client

Inside your project root, run the following:

```sh
xata init
```

Accept the defaults. By the end you should have a `.env` file generated for you within your app folder. This file will contain the correct credentials to access your database from your Cloudflare worker.

```bash title=".env"
XATA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
XATA_BRANCH=main
```

### Initialize Xata Client

There are two ways of initiailizing Xata client in Cloudflare workers:

1.  ES Modules Syntax (Recommended)
2.  Service Workers Syntax (Deprecated)

#### ES Modules Syntax (Recommended)

```ts title="index.ts"
import { XataClient } from './xata';

export interface Env {
  XATA_BRANCH: string;
  XATA_API_KEY: string;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const xata = new XataClient({
      apiKey: env.XATA_API_KEY,
      branch: env.XATA_BRANCH
    });
    // Note that the table name "Posts" may vary
    // depending on the shape of your schema
    const posts = await xata.db.Posts.getAll();
    return new Response(`Total Posts: ${posts.length}`);
  }
};
```

#### Service Workers Syntax (Deprecated)

```ts title="index.ts"
import { XataClient } from './xata';

async function handler(request: Request) {
  const xata = new XataClient({
    apiKey: XATA_API_KEY,
    branch: XATA_BRANCH
  });
  // Note that the table name "Posts" may vary
  // depending on the shape of your schema
  const posts = await xata.db.Posts.getAll();
  return new Response(`Total Posts: ${posts.length}`);
}

// Initialize Worker
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handler(event.request));
});
```

### Local environment variables

Copy your Xata environment values into a new file called .dev.vars. This allows Cloudflare access to them in dev mode.

```bash title=".dev.vars"
XATA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
XATA_BRANCH=main
```

### Remote environment variables

In order to make these environment variables accessible in your worker when it is deployed remotely, there are two options:

1.  One click guided workflow from the Cloudflare dashboard (Recommended)
2.  Manually through the Cloudflare dashboard

#### One click guided workflow (Recommended)

Going through this flow automatically sets the environment variables necessary to interact with your database from a remote Cloudflare worker.

Your endpoint response should also be available remotely at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev.`

#### Manual

1.  Navigate to the Cloudflare dashboard
2.  Navigate to your corresponding Worker
3.  Under Settings tab > Variables > Add variable add you environment variables
4.  Refresh your deployment
